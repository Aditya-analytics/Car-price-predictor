## 🚀 Deploy to Render (Recommended - 100% Free)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one): https://github.com/signup

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `car-price-predictor` (or any name you like)
   - Make it **Public**
   - Don't initialize with README (your project already has one)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\suyas\OneDrive\Desktop\gemini_car
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/car-price-predictor.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 2: Deploy on Render

1. **Create a Render account**: https://render.com/signup
   - You can sign up with your GitHub account

2. **Connect GitHub to Render**:
   - After signing up, go to Dashboard
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Click "Connect GitHub" and authorize Render
   - Find and select your `car-price-predictor` repository

3. **Configure your service**:
   - **Name**: `car-price-predictor` (or any name)

6. **Done!** 🎉 Your app is live!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations:
- **Cold starts**: App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Startup time**: Takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- **750 hours/month** of uptime (more than enough for testing)

### Keep Your App Awake (Optional):
Use a free service like **UptimeRobot** (https://uptimerobot.com) to ping your app every 5-10 minutes.

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployment

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
cd C:\Users\suyas\OneDrive\Desktop\gemini_car
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

Render will automatically rebuild and redeploy! 🚀
